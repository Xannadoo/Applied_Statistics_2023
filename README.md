## {Objective}

Investigate the association between personality traits and drug use patterns using Logistic regression, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and evaluation methods. \\

## {Analysis Plan} \\

%--------------------------------
## {Logistic Regression for Drug Use Prediction (Topic 2):} \\

--- Implement logistic regression models to predict current drug use (categorical) based on personality traits. 

--- Assess the significance of personality traits in predicting the likelihood of current drug use. 

--- Use Bayesian logistic regression to account for uncertainty in parameter estimates. \\

%-------------------------------
## {Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for Cluster Analysis (Topic 3): } \\

--- Apply GMM to identify potential clusters or subgroups among participants based on personality traits and drug use patterns. 

--- Assess the relevance of identified personality clusters in explaining variations in drug use behaviors. \\


%-------------------------------
## { Confidence Intervals (Topics 7):} \\

--- Evaluating logistic regression model by using Confidence Interval bound. 



%-------------------------------
## {Hypothesis Testing and False Discovery Rates (Topic 6):}

Conduct hypothesis tests to identify significant associations. Implement methods to control false discovery rates, considering the multiple comparisons involved in studying various personality traits.
