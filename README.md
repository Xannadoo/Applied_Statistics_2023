# Applied_Statistics_2023

## Objective

Investigate the association between personality traits and drug use patterns using Logistic regression, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and evaluation methods. \\

## Data

The data comes from a paper by [Fehrman et al](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified) and is publicly available. We undertook minimal data processing before starting this work so the dataset can be found in the [data](https://github.com/Xannadoo/Applied_Statistics_2023/tree/main/data) folder.

## Analysis Code

[Code](https://github.com/Xannadoo/Applied_Statistics_2023/tree/main/code) contains all the files needed to reproduce our analysis.
- data_exploration.ipynb contains the EDA, and initial dataset analysis
- GaussianMixtures.py contains code pertaining to the gaussian mixture analysis
- logistic_regression.ipynb contains the code pertaining to the logistic regression model

## Requirements:

+ Python 3.11.4
+ numpy 1.26.0
+ pandas1.5.3
+ statsmodels 0.14.0
