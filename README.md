## {Objective}

Investigate the association between personality traits and drug use patterns using Bayesian inference, logistic regression, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and non-parametric methods. \\

## {Analysis Plan} \\

%--------------------------------
## {Logistic Regression for Drug Use Prediction (Topic 2):} \\

--- Implement logistic regression models to predict current drug use (categorical) based on personality traits. 

--- Assess the significance of personality traits in predicting the likelihood of current drug use. 

--- Use Bayesian logistic regression to account for uncertainty in parameter estimates. \\

%-------------------------------
## {Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for Cluster Analysis (Topic 3): } \\

--- Apply GMM to identify potential clusters or subgroups among participants based on personality traits and drug use patterns. 

--- Assess the relevance of identified clusters in explaining variations in drug use behaviors. \\


%-------------------------------
## {Non-Parametric Bootstrap for Confidence Intervals (Topics 4 and 5):} \\

--- Implement non-parametric bootstrap methods to estimate confidence intervals for key parameters obtained from logistic regression and GMM.

--- Assess the robustness of the model estimates through bootstrap resampling.

--- Integrate Bayesian methods to compare and validate results obtained through non-parametric bootstrap. \\


%-------------------------------
## {Hypothesis Testing and False Discovery Rates (Topic 6):}

Conduct hypothesis tests to identify significant associations. Implement methods to control false discovery rates, considering the multiple comparisons involved in studying various personality traits.
